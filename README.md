# Football News Automation

This project automates the process of scraping the latest football news headlines from "The Sun" sports section using Selenium and stores the results in a CSV file. The script is designed to run headlessly, making it suitable for automation on servers or in CI/CD pipelines.

## Features

- Scrapes the latest football news headlines, subtitles, and links from [The Sun Football News](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/).
- Uses Selenium WebDriver for web scraping.
- Handles SSL errors using Chrome options.
- Saves the scraped data into a CSV file with the current date.
- Headless execution for automated and background scraping.

## Tech Stack

- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **Selenium:** For web scraping and browser automation.
- **Pandas:** To process and save the scraped data into a CSV file.
- **Chrome WebDriver:** To control Chrome browser for scraping.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Google Chrome installed.
- ChromeDriver compatible with your Chrome version. [Download ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
- Necessary Python packages:
  - `selenium`
  - `pandas`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vipul2912/football-news-automation.git
   cd football-news-automation
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Make sure to install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install selenium pandas
   ```

3. **Set Up ChromeDriver:**

   - Download ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome browser version from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).
   - Update the `path` variable in the script to point to your ChromeDriver executable.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**

   Execute the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python football_news_automation.py
   ```

   - The script will open the Chrome browser in headless mode, navigate to the specified website, and scrape the football news headlines, subtitles, and links.
   - The scraped data will be saved into a CSV file named `headline-MMDDYYYY.csv` in the directory where the script is executed.

2. **Customizing the Output Path:**

   If you want to change the location where the CSV file is saved, modify the `application_path` variable in the script.

## Code Explanation

- **Selenium Setup:** 
  - The script uses Selenium to automate Chrome. It ignores SSL errors and runs in headless mode for a seamless and automated experience.
- **Scraping Logic:**
  - It navigates to "The Sun" football news section and waits for elements to load using `WebDriverWait`.
  - It extracts titles, subtitles, and links from each news container using XPath.
- **Data Export:**
  - Extracted data is stored in a pandas DataFrame and exported to a CSV file named with the current date for easy tracking.

## Error Handling

- The script includes basic error handling to skip containers that can't be processed due to missing elements.
- Exceptions encountered during the scraping process are printed to the console for debugging purposes.

## Notes

- Ensure that the version of ChromeDriver matches your installed version of Chrome. Mismatched versions can lead to errors.
- If you encounter issues with SSL errors or certificate warnings, the script uses Chrome options to ignore them.
